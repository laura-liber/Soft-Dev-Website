</html>
<p>I am a Software Developer with a background in Computer Networking. I started off my computer career in the Navy as an Aegis Computer Networking Technician and have an Associates of Art as well as a Bachelors of Science.

</p>
<p>Prior to my Navy career I was a professional dancer including musical theater productions across the country and instructing ballroom dance classes at the collegiate level. I have also had businesses in Photography and Clothing Line creation. 

</p>
<p>On the homefront I have a toddler and my husband is currently active duty Navy. I still sew and take pictures as hobbies, I'm an avid cook and enjoy spending copious amounts of time in our gardens. Our aspiration is to eventually be a homestead.</p>
